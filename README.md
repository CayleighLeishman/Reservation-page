# Reservation-page
Allows users to say "yes" or "no" to a request

# Overview

I'm trying to get used to writing in html and get some practice with creating something in a web app that is not just 'text' on a page. 

In this web app, I created two html pages, that allowed people to type in their first and last name, and another html page that allowed people to click a button to answer "yes", "no" or "maybe." 

I wanted to write this software becuase I wanted to get some practice with creatign a web app that does more than just have a layout.

# Web Pages


What the web app is supposed to do is when you put in the first and last name was connect to a database and python would set it up so if your name is in the database. Then it would go to the html website and allow the user to click one of the three buttons on the webpage to say if they were going to an event or not. 
In main.html it just contains code for poeple to write their names in, while page2.html has the buttons on the page. Right now these don't lead anywhere, however I am still proud of having it so that you can click or even type in, even though it dosen't lead anywhere.

# Development Environment

I used visual studio code to write in the html and download Djason that had python code. 

I used python and a bit of Djson to get started. Djson is for back end development of websites. I did not get to write in python this week, but I did download Djason which downloaded python code.

# Future Work

* Get more practice with Django
* Create a database to get the html code to work (and in python write something that says 'when the name is typed if that person is in the database, lead the person to the reservation page.')
* Get more practice with css.
